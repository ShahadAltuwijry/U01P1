                <!-- <p class="description" id="description">Ursula (also known as the Sea Witch) is the main antagonist of
                    Disney's 1989
                    animated feature film The Little Mermaid.
                    She is a villainous Cecaelia (half-woman, half-octopus) who strikes deals with unfortunate merfolk
                    with the
                    promise of
                    making their dreams come true. Ursula's contracts, however, are covertly designed to advance her own
                    ambitions
                    and cause
                    general misery. In the past, Ursula was a resident of King Triton's palace, before being banished
                    and exiled by
                    order of
                    the king. Scorned, she has since vowed to exact vengeance by harnessing the power of the king's
                    trident and
                    installing
                    herself as ruler of all the ocean.
                    Honestly I don't see Ursula as a Villain in this movie and that's because Ariel read the contract
                    and signed it, agreeing to all the condetions so why is it Ursula's fault that she's following the
                    laws and coming to take what's hers?
                    Some people will just agree with the main character of the movie just because he is, but if we think
                    logically Ursula wasn't at fault but a lot of people might not agree with me on that.
